When you heard of a word ‘Ethics’, what do you think about? In general, you might think ‘I could lose money’.
Let me introduce you an article. There is an article saying ‘A good company has good people rather than good technologies. Ethics, rather than profits, results a company of 200 year.
What the article states is this. Ethisphere Institute, a global research institute for business ethics has named a company as the most ethical enterprise for 8 years. That is Schneider Electric. The article above is an interview of Eric Leger, senior vice president of global marketing.
To give brief information about Schneider Electric, the company is established in France 1836. It is a global enterprise of energy control and process automation with a history of 182 years.
It is also a company that has extended to over 100 countries. Its market share of global uninterruptable power supply(UPS) reaches 40%.
It is also a company known for its long-term contributions such as the support for energy poor, and its workplace culture of gender equality.
According to Eric Leger, the senior vice president of such enterprise, “If I am asked to choose between a profit and ethics of your company, I unconditionally choose the ethics without a doubt.”
At the same time, he emphasized the importance of ethics saying “it takes a long time for a company to build good reputation, it is easily collapsed by a single mistake in the aspect of ethics”.
Let me show you another article. ‘the loss of domestic enterprise by cyber attacks reaches 79 trillion wons’.
In June 2018, Microsoft Korea, in a cooperation with Frost & Sullivan which is a global consulting company, presented a report on cyber threats.
According to the report, direct and indirect loss of domestic enterprise caused by botnet attacks that result lots of zombie PCs, ransomware attacks, and phishing attacks reach about 79 trillion wons which is about 5% of GDP.
Moreover, large enterprises in South Korea were reported to averagely have a financial loss of 30 billion wons for each.
Seunghwan Choi, a board member of Frost & Sullivan stated such loss is only an iceberg phenomenon and the iceberg under water, indirect and additional loss being hidden, is much serious.
Customer churn as a result of cyber attack, a loss of business reputation, an unemployment as a punishment for responsibility. The damage caused by such indirect loss and additional loss reaches almost 90% of the overall loss, says he.
Along with such situation, there is a report on the condition of security awareness in domestic countries.
According to the awareness survey, however, 39% of domestic enterprises has replied that they do not know whether there was a security breach or a cyber attack.
About 10% of the respondents replied that they have experienced a security breach, and another 10% replied that they are not aware whether there was a cyber attack.
Along with the rapid growth of technologies, there are more cases that abuse technologies. And the methods of abuse has become more sophisticated.
However, the user’s security or ethic awareness is still low. And there has been no action on it.
We call today as the era of the 4th industrial revolution. If we say the era of the 3rd industrial revolution was on information technology, the era of the fourth industrial revolution is an intelligence information society centered on the intelligence information.
Having its basis on connection and intelligence, it is a society that not ourselves but human beings and objects, together with intelligence, lead.
The society can be explained by IoT, cloud, big data, and mobile(ICBM) or data, network, and AI(DNA).
It is a society where information technology and intelligence called as AI are combined so that a bulk of data is generated, continuously developed, and expanded.
An AI product independently operates judging and deciding by itself. And it generates another function that seeks for a new goal by deep learning, by learning a new function by itself.
Therefore, new ethical issues, that cannot be dealt with existing ethical criteria, are occurring.
For instance, there are cases of autonomous vehicles that you have heard a lot. To see an exemplary case, there was a case that a Tesla vehicle left the road in California, USA. The car crashed through the fence and fell into a pond so that it ended up with a death of its driver.
It is not yet found whether the vehicle was on auto-pilot mode which is the partially autonomous driving mode of Tesla, or the driver drove overspeed or under the influence.
Today, from such cases, many people bring up an issue on ‘whether an autonomous vehicle is safe?’.
If such accident of autonomous vehicle occurs, who would have the responsibility?
Regarding such questions, The Korea Transport Institute conducted a survey about the Ethics of autonomous car targeting drivers, non-drivers licenses and experts. The targets were 400 of drivers, 300 of non-drivers licenses and 75 of experts.
Firstly, for the quesiton about compliance with traffic regulations during driving on the road by the autonomous car, especially with speed limit, 73% of drivers, 78% of non-drivers licenses and 67% of experts answered that it must throughly comply with the traffic regulations.
In addition, when questioned about the responsibility in the case of violation of the traffic regulation during the autonomous car, which is not owned by an individual, but owned by joint owner, the opinions from the drivers, non-drivers licenses and experts were that the shared car owner or manufacturer is highly responsible for the violation.
44% of drivers and 38% of non-drivers licenses answered that it is a responsibility of the joint owner of the shared car and 75 of experts answered that it is a responsibility of the shared car system operator.
Additionally, the response rate for the opinion that it is a responsibility of manufacturer were shown 31% of drivers, 34% of non-drivers licenses and 27% of experts. 14% of drivers and 9% of non-drivers licenses answered that it is a responsibility of the passenger, on the other hand, only 8% of experts answered that it is a responsibility of the passenger.
Apart from the opinions, 22% of experts answered that all the three parties are responsible.
Next, for the question about the responsibility during the autonomous car driving without a passenger, the answered were shown noticeably different. Firstly, 33% of drivers and 26% of non-drivers licenses answered that it is a responsibility of the owner of the autonomous car, however, only 16% of the expert answered that it is a responsibility of the owner.
Additionally, the response rate for the opinion that it is a responsibility of the manufacturer were shown 40% of the drivers and 35% of the non-driver licenses, on the other hand, 52% of experts, which is more than half of the expert group answered that the manufacturer is responsible for the accident occurred during the autonomous car driving.
The response rate of the opinion that all the parties are partially responsible were shown 27% of drivers, 38% of non-drivers licenses and 30% of experts.
Likewise, besides the dysfunctions such as addiction, data spill of personal information, infringement of copyright, and security breach, the era of the fourth industry resulted new ethical issues for a manufacturer, provider, user, or owner as a result of AI software and robot industry.
Therefore, this course is to let you consider what to prepare as a digital citizen in the intelligence information society by discussing about major issues of digital ethics being focused on the feature of the era of the fourth industrial revolution.
Today in particular, by interviewing an expert in the field, we are going to see what kinds of ethical issues appear in the industries encountering the era of the fourth industrial revolution.
It would be a time for you to practically recognize the needs of ethics by the interview.
Cheol Park, a board member. 2000.1~2008.8 / CEO of Diginics 2008.8~2012.0 / CEO of Say Beat Telecom 2012.9~2017.3 / Board member of Accupix 2017.3~ / Present board member of Korea Artificial Intelligence Association
Q : What is Korea Artificial Intelligence Association(KORAIA)?
A : KORAIA is an association of the thinking people with a proposition of the future we choose as the society is entering to the era of the fourth industrial revolution.
Although it is an association established being headed by various start-up companies and ICT companies, its members include AI experts and others interested in human beings and this era as well.
It is because the future world would utilize data from collective intelligence and convergence technology resulted from mature social consciousness.
We are focusing on the enjoyable communication with the world without building any barrier of AI technology.
In a sense, you can say that we are just ordinary citizens who share the meaning of the realization of human dignity through the fourth industrial revolution while working diligently in where each of us belongs despite of the field.
Therefore, with the goal of realization of a human-focus society along with technology, we are to have the role of game changer that designs the criteria of new era and civilization rather than being dragged by changing world.
Q : What is a major key word of business management or technological development in the era of the 4th industrial revolution?
A : Although the goal of an enterprise is a profit, the most important thing for business management would be a permanency. The enterprise should be continued.
One of the barriers that an enterprise experiences while manufacturing or selling is the ethics. As there are many cases that the ethics conflicts with a profit, it becomes an issue for an enterprise.
At such time, although the immediate profit might be greater, it returns as a considerable blow against the permanency of the enterprise in many cases.
As the technology is developed, such issues increases. Therefore, the ethics would be a very important keyword for enterprise activities.
Q : What would be the possible ethical issue in the era of the fourth industrial revolution?
A : As it is a society where information and technology lead, different ethical issues occur on the production, distribution, and use of information and technology.
Issues regarding information security on the process of information distribution via the Internet, copyright issues on the process of development, and various accidents of malfunction are occurring. Such issues are considered to have a close relation with ethics.
Q : Case regarding possible ethical issues in the era of the fourth industrial revolution.
A: In fact, my company developed a new product and the product resulted a good response so that the company profit increased and received compliments.
Then, some of the employees who were involved in the product development left the company, established a separate company, duplicated the product, and sold it.
Firstly, it was an infringement of copyright. And it was a violation of Trade Secret Protection Act. It was an immoral behavior that could result a death blow on business activities.
Due to it, my company had a huge blog that resulted a terrible financial difficulty. And those who established the company personally encountered legal problems.
There was an Internet phone service company that one of my friends owned. The company had a case being sued because customer information was spilled.
It was a case that an employee of the company spilled customer information to a rival company. It resulted not just a blow on the company where its information was robbed but other inconveniences as customer information was spilled. The company was sued by its customers.
Recently, I participated on an ethics forum regarding AI held by National Information Society Agency. During the forum, many debates were processed by the participations of related enterprises, researchers, and the government.
I found out that there are a lot of people who seriously concerns different influences that AI technology could affect and following ethical issues.
Q : What are the ethical issues that could potentially occur along with increase of industries regarding AI, the Internet of Things, and big data?
An AI causes a problem by itself it not just a story in the future but one of the issues in recent days.
You must know that an AI speaker recently run a voice recorder lately without a request from its user. And it sent one’s private life via E-mail.
And, as the Internet of Things is designed to remote control the whole functions, if it is hacked, it would result something unwanted.
A touch sensor might seem free from the ethical issues but it also has a high risk of a damage by data spill since, in case of healthcare or something alike that the technology is applied on, there are many functions or services that saves personal information.
Q : What would be a social responsibility of an enterprise regarding development of new technology and commercialization?
A : For any enterprise, it has a responsibility to contribute on the society. Thus, when a product or service is introduced, the enterprise must consider possible influence of the new technology for human beings. And there should be ample prevention strategies against a malfunction or hacking.
And the product and service should be designed to be a help for human beings. Something that has a harm must be refrained by the enterprise itself.
Q : What is KORAIA preparing for the AI ethics?
A : For now, KORAIA is preparing strategies to control the AI technology ethically.
Basically, we are trying to head toward a direction that the AI technology becomes a help for the human beings through the certification and standardization of products.
As an effort, we have a committee of certification and standardization. We are trying to provide a guideline for technological development and the usage of technology.
In future, there will be lots of AI products. From the committee, we are trying to estimate such products depending on certain strategy having its safety on the top, to rate the level of its technical skills, and to provide such information for the users.
Q : Do you have any words for the students taking this course?
A : It is not an exaggeration to say that human history has been achieved by numerous number of developers. Their efforts, inventions, and technologies have been contributed to the human beings. Moreover, through the industrial revolution, the power and value of technology have been emphasized. As a result, the role of technicians has become important.
In particular, as the ICT is leading human society, students learning engineering must be more burdened.
You must notice a lot, once a technology is unproperly used, it could result an enormous damage. You should remember the ethics of developer so that you would not hack into others or develop any technology that harms others.
Along with such ethics, you should understand laws and regulations regarding engineering enough to prevent yourself committing a crime without knowing it. The future of human beings is on you. I hope you never forget that.
Q : What are the influence that AI technology has on human beings and the ethical measures on it?
A : As you know, AI is amazingly being developed. To what level the AI would be developed? That is a big issue for many researchers.
A lot of IT enterprises researching AI are studying what to do with AI and what would be a potential problem if the level of AI almost reaches the level of human intelligence.
Well, in my opinion, the AI would be developed to the similar level of our intelligence. So that it would judge and generate codes or products required by itself.
And it would be a critical risk for the human beings if unproperly used. For instance, it could control weapons or hack into itself to disturb the systems implemented by human beings.
To control them, fundamentally, the developers should have a strong ethical awareness. It would be required for them to develop a control code in order to prevent such abuse of technologies so that our safety would be guaranteed.
Therefore, later, I think it is very important to promptly build ethical guidelines to lead the direction of development so that we can develop AIs that only give us benefits without any harm on human beings.
