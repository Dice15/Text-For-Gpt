In this class, we are going to discuss about the concept of copyright and its understanding. We are living in the era of one-person media. Anyone can upload writings, photos, and video clips on SNS. From the aspect, any of us can be a copyright holder. Today, we are to discuss about the copyright.
Before we begin, have you ever thought of this? An issue whether an idea can be copyrighted.
If someone took my idea and created a work, can I say 'It is my work as well. I do own a copyright'? Think about the issue while taking today's class.
At the top of all, let's see the concept of copyright and its types. A copyright is an exclusive right that is assigned to the author of a work by the law.
A copyright of something becomes effective from the point of its creation. It is non-formality that does not require any format, a prerequisite, or a registering process. Automatically a copyright is assigned.
A work refers to a creation that expressed thoughts or emotions. The work includes literary works, art works, photos, musics, and videos.
The literary work includes novels, poems, and articles. And there is a diagrammatic work that includes maps, charts, and blueprints.
There are play works, art works, and architectural works. You might have been using photographic works a lot. There are photographic, cinematographic, and musical works.
And there are computer programing works that we all know well. In addition, there are derivative works that generates a new work from the original work. And there are compilation works that combines different materials, edits, and arranges.
An author of a work refers to the person who created the work. To the author, a moral right and an author's property right are assigned.
The requirements for establishment of a work is that the work expressed a human, the author's thoughts or emotions. For the requirements, there is a dichotomy of idea expression. That means a work must have a creativity and an externality.
Earlier I asked 'whether an idea can be copyrighted?' but an idea is not something expressed with an externality. That is the dichotomy of idea expression that a work must be something externally expressed.
It is a work that externally expressed a certain thought with a creativity. And it is the copyright that is assigned on the person who created the work.
In addition, you should have heard of an intellectual property right. What is a copyright and what is an intellectual property right? You must get confused a lot. You'd better have an understanding about what an intellectual property is.
I once said an author holds a moral right and an author's property right. Being differed by the author's property right, an intellectual property right refers to a property right in a broader view that includes the author's property right. The intellectual property right, as a term that includes the author's property right, refers to the author's property right + an industrial property right.
Then, what would be an industrial property right? It refers to the rights that are relevant to the all products that you can see in the industries. As a generic term that includes the patents, utility model rights, trademark rights, and design rights. Including the rights on different products or works, they are called as industrial property rights.
To summarize, an intellectual property right refers to all property rights generated by intellectual activities. It can be divided into an industrial property right that has a purpose of industrial development and a copyright that has a purpose of cultural development.
Now we are discussing about copyrights. In the era of one-person media, any content you upload generates a copyright. However, if you introduce a product as an industrial material, an industrial property right is generated.
At the same time, you may have heard of 'Jijeokjaesangwon'. It is an old term for the intellectual property right. The term of intellectual property right 'Jisikjaesangwon' is legally in use today.
Let me give you an example of a copyright and it of an intellectual property right. One day, a student from the College of Arts in Seoul Women's University visited me with a notebook.
Once I taught a lecture on creativity and the student brought a notebook saying my lecture inspired her. It was a notebook that she designed during a vacation. She gave it to me as a gift so that I accepted it with a pleasure.
The thing is she told me a story that she had posted some pages of the designed notebook on her SNS and she found a design company, a very famous one, was pirating her design.
I couldn't stand the situation so that I let her know her copyright was infringed. And she promptly took an action against the infringement with a participation of professors, a lawyer, and the school.
After that, she registered her design and also proceeded a business registration so that she eventually became a CEO.
As a result, the student began to produce and sell the notebook. It was a case that a copyright became an intellectual property right.
Then, is the all of works copyrighted? It is not true. There are works that are not copyrighted.
For the works not protected by copyrights are the Constitution, the laws, treaties, orders, ordinances, regulations, notifications from a nation or a local government, notices, disciplines, and the court's rulings. Also, personnel appointments, obituaries or news reports that simply delivers a fact, cannot be copyrighted.
Thinking of the Constitution or a precedent, it is a public work opened to the all people. As such cannot be copyrighted, you can write a book with the Constitution or an article with a precedent.
So far we have discussed about a concept of copyright. Can you now distinguish a copyright and an intellectual property right? In the next class, we are going to discuss about the types of copyright in detail.
In the last class, we discussed about the concepts of copyright. In this class, we are going to discuss about the types of copyrights.
A copyright is more complicated than we think. A single copyright includes a moral right, an author's property right, and a neighboring copyright. Let's take a look on what they are.
First of all, a moral right is a character and psychological rights that an author has for own work.
The moral right is divided into three: a right of publication, a right of paternity, and a right of integrity.
Firstly, a right of publication, as a part of an author's character, refers to a right that the author can decide the publication of own work.
For instance, if an author draw a webcomic, it is a right that the author can publish it when the author wants to.
Secondly, a right of paternity is a right to tag the author's name. It is that shows the author by tagging the author's pen name or real name.
Thirdly, a right of integrity is a right to retain an identity of the contents, format, and title of a work.
As the contents what its author wrote, as the format what its author made, and as the title what its author chose, the identity should be retained. That is the right of integrity.
A user, in principle, should not change any of its content or format. Without a permission from its author, any of these rights of publication, paternity, or integrity must be protected.
There is a say that a moral right has non monetary and personal nature. The non monetary nature refers that the moral of an author is not a tradable property interest. That is, a non monetary nature is something above money.
The other nature of a moral right is personnel. The personnel nature refers that it is a right that wholly belongs to the author so that the right is non-transferable.
For a copyright, there is an author's property right as well. The author's property right is even more complicated. It is a property right that an author holds for the use of a work.
In other words, the author's property right is a right tradable. Being differed from the moral right, it is a property right and transferable.
In the author's property right, there are rights of reproduction, public transmission, distribution, rental, performance, exhibition, and adaptation.
To see each of them, a right of reproduction is the right regarding its printing, shooting, duplication, and recording.
Generally, we copy and use a digital data through the Internet. The right arose at the moment is the right of reproduction.
If you copy a webcomic and uploaded on somewhere, it is an infringement of the right of reproduction.
There is a right of public transmission. A public transmission as a part of property right refers to the action of transferring a work by wire or wirelessly, transmitting, or providing a work to someone else.
Simply saying, a public transmission is transmitting something by wire or wirelessly to someone using a smart device or other device that has an Internet connection. If you transmitted something that you shouldn't have, it is an infringement of the right of public transmission.
I previously said it is an infringement of the right of reproduction. At the same time, there occurs an infringement of public transmission. It is because you transmitted it to someone else.
In the author's property right, there is a right of distribution as well. A right of distribution is to transfer or to rent a work with or without a cost.
Through an SNS, if a work is sent to other or posted on a board so that people can download it, it is an infringement of the right of distribution.
And there is a right of rental. It seems to be similar to the right of distribution but the rental is for-profit.
You must have watched many performances. Stagings, recitals, singings, speeches, and so on. The right occurred while doing such is the right of performance.
Au author of a work has a right to perform the work. And there is a right of exhibition for arts, photos, and architectural works.
And there is a right of adaptation. It is a right to create a new work by translating, arranging, modifying, and adapting its original work.
For the third type of a copyright, there is something called a neighboring copyright. I have already introduced the moral right and the author's property right that are assigned to an author.
There is a neighboring copyright that is assigned to the people next to the author, to the people who somehow cooperate with the author.
For the neighboring copyright, the rights for a performer, a record producer, or a producer. A performer refers to a person who actually performs it that is, a person who actually expresses a work by playing or singing.
To record, to film, or to photograph is what a performer do. A right assigned to the performer is one of neighboring copyright.
Also there is a right for a record producer. A right to reproduce and distribute a record.
To broadcasters, a neighboring copyright is also assigned. The right to record, to film, to reproduce as a photo, or to broadcast is the right assigned to its broadcasters.
Likewise, a copyright is complicatedly composed. The copyright is divided into a moral right and a property right for its author, and a neighboring right for people neighboring. And each of the three are divided into rights in detail.
Let me give you another example here. Despite of my age, I am a fan of BTS.
Let's say you watched a video clip of a music of BTS, enjoyed enough so that you filmed yourself choreographing imitating the clip and posted it online.
Then, is it an infringement of a copyright or not? To explain a bit more, you filmed it while watching a TV show on your screen but the TV show itself is not directly recorded on your clip. It is a case only the music is recorded on your clip that filmed yourself imitating the choreography. And you posted it online.
Is it an infringement? You may think 'Why is it so? It is just a video clip of myself dancing.'
When you remind yourself what we have been discussing so far, there is a serious infringement. It is the music being recorded.
If the music is posted online being recorded and if you had a number of viewers, it is an infringement of the right of distribution and public transmission. Moreover, it is an infringement of the rights regarding its broadcasters.
If you do not know how to handle it properly, you could be sued. And you might encounter a difficulty. That is a possible conflict regarding copyrights.
Let's take a look on a case even more complicated. It is an actual case from the copyright precedents. While I read this for you, please think about what was a problem and its result.
For sure, there are a plaintiff and a defendant. The plaintiff and defendant raised an issue of a music CD. The plaintiff was a group that had a permission for copyright trust management business by the copyright law. The defendant was a coffee franchise that world-widely has its branches.
The head office of the defendant, that is, the head office of the coffee franchise, in order to provide a background music service in shop, had a service providing contract with a company that had a permission of reproduction and distribution of the issued music from the US copyright holder.
A CD or an exclusive album, that is made in accordance with the contract, was provided and domestic branches were playing the music.
The exclusive album was playable only on a specific player, and it was made in a format that is unable to play when its contract expires. In addition, the contract was was to discard or return the CD after its expiration.
The thing was the exclusive album included a music that its right of performance had been in trust by the plaintiff domestically.
The plaintiff sued the defendant saying that playing the music using the exclusive album was a performance without his permission which was an infringement of a copyright. The plaintiff asked a ban of playing the music. That is, it was an issue because the contents without his permission was played in-country.
The issue was whether the action of playing the exclusive album was a case that performed an album for sale without a consideration from its audiences, which is a reason of restriction for the author's property right. That regards of Article 29(2) of the Copyright Act.
It is because playing an album for sale without any consideration being provided is not an infringement of its copyright.
That is, the issue of the case was whether the exclusive album was a type of an album for sale, and if it was, whether the main content of the performance was listening to the music.
On the first trial, the decision was it was not an infringement saying 'the main business of the defendant is to sell coffees and cakes in order to gain profit rather than to play a music and to listen to it. Therefore, he played the music without a purpose of taking profit from it. It can be a part of his business but not a main content.'
Was the case end here? The appeal resulted a decision totally different. The appeal court, in opposite, ruled that the defendant infringed the right of performance of the plaintiff.
There were reasons. Although the defendant states he had a permission to perform the music in South Korea from each of the author's property right holders, but the court ruled that 'Although the defendant was permitted to reproduce and distribute the work, it is not enough to admit as a permission to perform in South Korea. There is no evidence to admit it.'
As a result, the appeal court agreed with the plaintiff who stated the music should not be played and the defendant playing the issued CD infringed the right of performance of the plaintiff.
As the defendant had never received a permission to perform the musical work, performing it at a shop or any place of business is an infringement despite of its format. Likewise, the copyright holds complicate issues.
What would be the term of protection for copyright? The author's property right and neighboring copyright is protected for the author's lifetime and 70 years after death. If there is a co-author, it is protected for 70 years after death of the last co-worker.
For the 70 years of protection, there is something missing, right? The term of protection for the moral right. Why is the term not determined?
In fact, the moral right regarding the author's honor, psychological right, and personality, has no specified term for protection. Even after the author's death, the family of the deceased can ask a protection for the moral right if a defamation for the author is observed.
Si far, we have discussed about the types of works and copyrights. In next class, we will discuss about the infringement and protection of copyrights.
